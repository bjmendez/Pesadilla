# User Story
As a player playing Pesadilla I want a 2D Action type RPG similar to Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Binding of Isaac. I'm hoping for a tower design where each floor is a level and each level is finished by killing a boss. Upon killing the boss I can progress to the next level. I want to be able to attack enemies and kill them, and die if they deal enough damage to me. If I kill the final boss on at the top floor of the tower then I win the game but, if I die along the way I will restart at the first floor.
